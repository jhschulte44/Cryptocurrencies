# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
This project had us clean and transform cryptocurreny data with the hopes of determining which would be worthwile investments. To start, after loading the csv file into a pandas DataFrame, I was able to reduce the data features using Principal Component Analysis. From there, I clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-Means into 4 clusters and plotted the results.
